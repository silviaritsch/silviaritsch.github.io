I'm a doctoral student in cryptography in the Applied Cryptography and Provable Security Group @ Eindhoven University of Technology under supervision of [Andreas Huelsing](https://huelsing.net/) and [Kathrin Hoevelmanns](https://hoevelmanns.net/).
My research interests include password-authenticated key exchange and its security proofs, in particular against attackers with quantum computing capabilities.

I'm a member of the Quantum Safe Internet (QSI) doctoral network [QSI](https://quantum-safeinternet.com/), working on securing key exchange under quantum attack.

Maybe you remember me from when I studied Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at ETH Zurich, where I focused on Network Security and Applied Cryptography.
