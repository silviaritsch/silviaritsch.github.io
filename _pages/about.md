I'm a doctoral student in cryptography in the Applied Cryptography and Provable Security Group @ Eindhoven University of Technology under supervision of [Andreas Huelsing](https://huelsing.net/) and [Kathrin Hoevelmanns](https://hoevelmanns.net/).
My research interests include password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) and its security proofs, in particular against attackers with quantum computing capabilities.

I'm a member of the Quantum Safe Internet doctoral network [QSI](https://quantum-safeinternet.com/), working on securing key exchange under quantum attack.

Before starting my PhD, I studied Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at ETH Zurich, where I focused on Network Security and Applied Cryptography.

In 2020, I worked as an intern at Supercomputing Systems AG Zurich, specializing on embedded software and IoT.
